# Experimental-Image-Denoising-using-SVD-Reconstruction-and-Local-Thresholding
This combined approach attempts to remove noise by selectively filtering the information captured by SVD and then refining the reconstruction with local comparisons. The effectiveness depends on the noise type, choice of ```n```, and thresholding parameters.
